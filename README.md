Object Tracking Simulation Project Using OpenCV: MOTA, SOTA, and LSOT
This project is a dynamic object tracking simulation developed in Python using OpenCV and other libraries, featuring three primary tracking algorithms: Multi-Object Tracking Algorithm (MOTA), Single-Object Tracking Algorithm (SOTA), and Large Single Object Tracking (LSOT). The simulation allows users to track multiple objects, a single object, or a large dominant object in real-time, with customizable features for each mode.

Features
Multi-Object Tracking (MOTA): Tracks multiple objects in real-time using the MultiTracker class from OpenCV, supporting unique ID assignment and accurate tracking through occlusions.
Single-Object Tracking (SOTA): Utilizes OpenCVâ€™s KCF tracker to follow a single object with high precision, adapting to occlusions and fast movements.
Large Single Object Tracking (LSOT): Designed for large dominant objects in the frame, maintaining focus and bounding box stability, even with rapid motion.
Interactive Bounding Box Selection: Allows users to select objects interactively in the first frame, providing flexibility in defining the tracked regions.
Real-Time Updates: Real-time frame-by-frame object position updates, with consistent visualization of bounding boxes.
Libraries Used
OpenCV (cv2): Core library for computer vision tasks, used for object tracking, video processing, and interactive bounding box selection.
sys: Assists in system control for managing video capture, ensuring a smooth exit if the video stream fails.
Installation
To run this project, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.

Run the simulation script:

bash
Copy code
python object_tracking_simulation.py
Follow the prompts to select objects to track:

For MOTA, select multiple objects by drawing bounding boxes and confirm each by pressing 'c'.
For SOTA and LSOT, select a single object to track.
Use the ESC key to exit the tracking session.
